Sometimes you have to share files, especially large using Sharepoint (tm).
It's mostly diabolic practic but we have to obey the rules.
File management in Sharepoint typically has inhuman interface but system administrators tends to restrict it more to have misirable file size limit and force to upload files one by one.
This is untolerable for most human beings and totaly outrageous act for software developers.

This cossplatform multithreaded utility here is to provide file operations command line support. Now it can only upload single or set of files to Sharepoint server.
Dowload and list operatoins along with progress report features (like wget) may be included in future versions or done by request.
